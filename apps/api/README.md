# API App

Server-side entrypoint for EEG workflows.

Expected responsibilities:

- expose dataset, workflow, job, and result endpoints
- validate request and response shapes
- compose workflow use cases with EEG I/O and processing packages
- handle authentication and runtime configuration when those features are added
- expose future chat-command endpoints without placing chat logic directly in the API layer

Do not put reusable EEG domain rules here. Move them to `packages/eeg-core`.
